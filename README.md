Welcome to the Microsoft Landing Page Clone repository! This project aims to recreate the official landing page of Microsoft's website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building this clone, we aim to enhance our front-end development skills, practice responsive web design, and gain experience in creating modern, user-friendly interfaces.
